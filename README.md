# Dented-Bot
Educational Bot  I made a while back to learn basics of how banking malware can steal data from you.

What is implemented:

RunPE, RUNDLL, Download + Execute, Registry Startup, POS grabber for track1+2 , Update, uninstall, formgrabber, webinject, HVNC using real VNC protocol and not some RFB impl.

Of course for obvious reasons I didnt release the whole project and Edited the panel on the server side to only show 1 bot  to prevent it from being used to steal real data.

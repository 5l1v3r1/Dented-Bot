# Dented-Bot
Educational Bot  I made a while back to learn basics of how banking malware can steal data from you.
What is implemented:
RunPE, RUNDLL, DOwnload + Execute, Registry, POS grabber for track1+2 , Update, uninstall, formgrabber, webinject, HVNC using real VNC protocol and not some RFB impl.

Of course for obvious reasons I didnt release the whole project
